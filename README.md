# MADNet

Volunteer/Fellow tool to aid all on-ground MAD operations. Progressive Web App(PWA) 

## Vision

We want to consolidate all existing volunteer and fellow tools into one mobile app(PWA). It should work online(in browser) as well as an app running on the phone. Volunteers should be able to do all their MAD tech activities thru this tool.
