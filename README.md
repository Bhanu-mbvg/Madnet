# MADNet

## Purpose

1. MADNet is created to replace MADApp and many other tools(Envite, Donut, UPMA, etc). The idea is to consolidate all volunteer and fellow tech function into one app - that being MADNet.
2. Update the main volunteer facing app to something using the latest tech - that being mobile first, PWA app that gives us capabilities like.. 
	- push notifications
	- contextual information
	- better UI/UX
	- ease of use
	- and more
